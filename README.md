# dwdunne-website-build-with-gulp

Web site initialized with Yeoman to get the environment established. Real-time builds are via Gulp to concat, uglify, etc... to improve runtime performance, and Sass is used to auto-generate the CSS.  

## to build, simply:

```
git clone ...
npm install
bower install
gulp && gulp serve
```

## Why?
I created this to explore the differences between Gulp and Grunt and the pros/cons of each for Front End Web Development.  

## Conclusion?
I much preferred developing with JavaScript in Gulp over the properties files in Grunt.
